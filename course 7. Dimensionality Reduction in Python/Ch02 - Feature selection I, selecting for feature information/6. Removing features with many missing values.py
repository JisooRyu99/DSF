'''
You'll apply feature selection on the Boston Public Schools dataset which has been pre-loaded as school_df. Calculate the missing value ratio per feature and then create a mask to remove features with many missing values.
'''

# Create a boolean mask on whether each feature less than 50% missing values.
mask = school_df.isna().sum() / len(school_df) < 0.5

# Create a reduced dataset by applying the mask
reduced_df = school_df.loc[:,mask]

print(school_df.shape)
print(reduced_df.shape)
