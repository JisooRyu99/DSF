'''
t-SNE is a great technique for visual exploration of high dimensional datasets. In this exercise, you'll apply it to the ANSUR dataset. You'll remove non-numeric columns from the pre-loaded dataset df and fit TSNE to his numeric dataset.
'''

# Non-numerical columns in the dataset
non_numeric = ['Branch', 'Gender', 'Component']

# Drop the non-numerical columns from df
df_numeric = df.drop(non_numeric, axis=1)

# Create a t-SNE model with learning rate 50
m = TSNE(learning_rate=50)

# Fit and transform the t-SNE model on the numeric dataset
tsne_features = m.fit_transform(df_numeric)
print(tsne_features.shape)
