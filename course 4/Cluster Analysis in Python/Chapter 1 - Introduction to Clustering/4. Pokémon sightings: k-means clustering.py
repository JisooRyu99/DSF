'''
We are going to continue the investigation into the sightings of legendary Pokémon from the previous exercise. Just like the previous exercise, we will use the same example of Pokémon sightings. In this exercise, you will form clusters of the sightings using k-means clustering.

x and y are columns of X and Y coordinates of the locations of sightings, stored in a pandas DataFrame, df. The following are available for use: matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns, and pandas as pd.
'''

# Import kmeans and vq functions
from scipy.cluster.vq import kmeans, vq

# Compute cluster centers
centroids,_ = kmeans(df, 2)

# Assign cluster labels
df['cluster_labels'], _ = vq(df, centroids)

# Plot the points with seaborn
sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', hue='cluster_labels', data=df)
plt.show()
