'''
Dendrograms are branching diagrams that show the merging of clusters as we move through the distance matrix. Let us use the Comic Con footfall data to create a dendrogram.

The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, comic_con. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the standardized X and Y coordinates of people at a given point in time. cluster_labels has the cluster labels. A linkage object is stored in the variable distance_matrix.

# Import the dendrogram function
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram

# Create a dendrogram
dn = dendrogram(distance_matrix)

# Display the dendogram
plt.show()
