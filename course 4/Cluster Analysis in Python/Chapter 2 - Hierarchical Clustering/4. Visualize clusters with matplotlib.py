We have discussed that visualizations are necessary to assess the clusters that are formed and spot trends in your data. Let us now focus on visualizing the footfall dataset from Comic-Con using the matplotlib module.

The data is stored in a pandas DataFrame, comic_con. x_scaled and y_scaled are the column names of the standardized X and Y coordinates of people at a given point in time. cluster_labels has the cluster labels. A linkage object is stored in the variable distance_matrix.

# Import the pyplot class
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Define a colors dictionary for clusters
colors = {1:'red', 2:'blue'}

# Plot a scatter plot
comic_con.plot.scatter(x='x_scaled', 
                	   y='y_scaled',
                	   c=comic_con['cluster_labels'].apply(lambda x: colors[x]))
plt.show()
