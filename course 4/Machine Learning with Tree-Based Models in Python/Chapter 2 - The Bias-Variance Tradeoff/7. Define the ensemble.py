'''
In the following set of exercises, you'll work with the Indian Liver Patient Dataset from the UCI Machine learning repository.

In this exercise, you'll instantiate three classifiers to predict whether a patient suffers from a liver disease using all the features present in the dataset.

The classes LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier under the alias KNN are available in your workspace.

# Set seed for reproducibility
SEED=1

# Instantiate lr
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate knn
knn = KNN(n_neighbors=27)

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=0.13, random_state=SEED)

# Define the list classifiers
classifiers = [('Logistic Regression', lr), ('K Nearest Neighbours', knn), ('Classification Tree', dt)]
