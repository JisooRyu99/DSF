'''
In model validation, it is often important to know more about the predictions than just the final classification. When predicting who will win a game, most people are also interested in how likely it is a team will win.

In this exercise, you look at the methods, .predict() and .predict_proba() using the tic_tac_toe dataset. The first method will give a prediction of whether Player One will win the game, and the second method will provide the probability of Player One winning. Use rfc as the random forest classification model.
'''

# Fit the rfc model. 
rfc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create arrays of predictions
classification_predictions = rfc.predict(X_test)
probability_predictions = rfc.predict_proba(X_test)

# Print out count of binary predictions
print(pd.Series(classification_predictions).value_counts())

# Print the first value from probability_predictions
print('The first predicted probabilities are: {}'.format(probability_predictions[0]))
